g_atomic_lock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
---------------------------------------------------------
void g_atomic_lock(uint8_t* atom)
void g_atomic_lock_dual(uint8_t* atom_1, uint8_t* atom_2)
---------------------------------------------------------

Used to perform thread-safe locking on a single byte. The given `atom` must
point to valid memory in the current threads address space.

On execution, it is checked whether the byte at `atom` is 0. If it is `0`, the
byte is set to `1`. If it is not `0`, the executing thread blocks until the
atom is set to `0`.

The `g_atomic_lock_dual` version extends this functionality to work on two
atoms. The function then blocks when both bytes are non-`0`. Once one of the
atoms becomes `0`, both atoms are set to `1`.
